# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a Kiro IDE extension that generates intelligent git commit messages using the currently selected AI model. The extension will analyze staged changes and generate contextually appropriate commit messages that follow best practices, helping developers write better commit messages more efficiently.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Kiro IDE, I want to generate commit messages automatically based on my staged changes, so that I can save time and ensure consistent, high-quality commit messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user has staged changes in their git repository THEN the extension SHALL analyze the diff and generate a commit message
2. WHEN the user invokes the commit message generator THEN the system SHALL use the currently selected AI model in Kiro IDE
3. WHEN a commit message is generated THEN the system SHALL present it to the user for review and editing before committing
4. WHEN no staged changes exist THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the generated commit messages to follow conventional commit format and best practices, so that my project maintains a clean and professional git history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating commit messages THEN the system SHALL follow conventional commit format (type(scope): description)
2. WHEN analyzing changes THEN the system SHALL identify the appropriate commit type (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore)
3. WHEN multiple files are changed THEN the system SHALL create a concise summary that captures the overall change
4. WHEN the commit message exceeds 50 characters for the subject line THEN the system SHALL provide a warning or suggestion

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access the commit message generator through multiple interfaces, so that I can use it in my preferred workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user right-clicks in the git panel THEN the system SHALL show a "Generate Commit Message" context menu option
2. WHEN the user uses the command palette THEN the system SHALL provide a "Generate Git Commit Message" command
3. WHEN the user has the source control panel open THEN the system SHALL show a generate button on the right side of the commit message input field
4. WHEN the extension is activated THEN all interface options SHALL be available and functional

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to customize the commit message generation behavior, so that it fits my project's specific conventions and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses extension settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to customize commit message templates
2. WHEN the user configures custom commit types THEN the system SHALL use those instead of default conventional commit types
3. WHEN the user sets a preferred commit message style THEN the system SHALL generate messages in that style
4. WHEN the user enables/disables certain analysis features THEN the system SHALL respect those preferences

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to handle edge cases gracefully, so that it works reliably in various git repository states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the current directory is not a git repository THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
2. WHEN there are merge conflicts THEN the system SHALL detect this state and adjust message generation accordingly
3. WHEN generating a message fails due to AI service issues THEN the system SHALL provide a fallback or error message
4. WHEN the user cancels the generation process THEN the system SHALL clean up properly without side effects

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to package and distribute this extension, so that other Kiro IDE users can install and use it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is built THEN the system SHALL create a distributable package compatible with Kiro IDE's extension system
2. WHEN the extension is installed THEN it SHALL integrate seamlessly with Kiro IDE's existing git functionality
3. WHEN the extension is published THEN it SHALL include proper metadata, description, and installation instructions
4. WHEN users install the extension THEN it SHALL activate automatically and be ready to use
